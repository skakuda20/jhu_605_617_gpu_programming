The example assignment shows a clear CPU vs GPU comparision using the chrono library to accurately measure
the runtime on each hardware type. The example code correctly handles memory management with the proper malloc, 
copy, and free calls. While the example main function tests straight vector addition, which is
a non-branching function, it fails to test and compare the performance of a similar function that does 
contain branching. The GPU timing is wrapped around add<<<...>>> without cudaDeviceSynchronize() which may
result in the timing being incorrect.
